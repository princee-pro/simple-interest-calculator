# Simple Interest Calculator (Bash)

A tiny Bash script that computes simple interest using the formula:  
**SI = (P × R × T) / 100**

## How to Run
1. Make the script executable: chmod +x simple-interest.sh  
2. Run it: ./simple-interest.sh  

You will be asked to enter:
- Principal (P)
- Rate (% per year) (R)
- Time (years) (T)

The script will then show the **Simple Interest**.
